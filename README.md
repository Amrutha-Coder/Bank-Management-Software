Banks are intermediaries between depositors (who lend money to the bank) and borrowers (to whom the bank lends money). 
Designing a robust system that allows you to engage in transactions is something that every beginner should get started with.
There should be a validation to allow only a particular amount of cash inflows at any time, as well as to allow withdrawals if the balance is sufficient. There should also be the calculation of interest and its addition to the balance every month.![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102223686/235849603-119d77dc-12f8-45e4-aa20-4a299465165d.jpg)
